## Stacked

Stacked is an application designed to allow users to search for and store book titles and associated information in a "stack" for later reference.  Users can add and remove titles from their stack and mark titles as "read."

To get started with Stacked and utilize the gulpfile.js, you will need to:

1. Install gulp globally:

  $ npm install --global gulp

2. Install gulp in your project directory:

  $ npm install --save-dev gulp

3.  Run gulp (some default tasks are set in gulpfile.js)

    $gulp

Stacked also relies on data from the Google Books API.  A key is needed for the AJAx call and can be obtained by following these instructions:  https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using?hl=en
